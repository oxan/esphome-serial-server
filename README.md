Stream server for ESPHome
=========================

Custom component for ESPHome to expose a UART stream over WiFi or Ethernet. Provides a serial-to-wifi bridge as known
from ESPLink or ser2net, using ESPHome.

This component creates a TCP server listening on port 6638 (by default), and relays all data between the connected
clients and the serial port. It doesn't support any control sequences, telnet options or RFC 2217, just raw data.

Usage
-----

Requires ESPHome v2022.3.0 or newer.

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://oxan/esphome-stream-server

stream_server:
```

You can set the UART ID and port to be used under the `stream_server` component.

```yaml
uart:
   id: uart_bus
   # add further configuration for the UART here

stream_server:
   uart_id: uart_bus
   port: 1234
```

Welcome/MOTD Message
--------------------

The optional 'banner' property allows to specify a string text to be always sent to client upon connecting.
This is very useful for things like always forcing telnet client into character mode.
Example: 

```yaml
stream_server:
  banner: "\xFF\xFB\x01\xFF\xFB\x03\xFF\xFC\x34\r\nWelcome to my console"
```

The example above sends a special sequence to telnet that disables local echo and enables character mode.

Sensors
-------
The server provides a binary sensor that signals whether there currently is a client connected:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: stream_server
    connected:
      name: Connected
```

It also provides a numeric sensor that indicates the number of connected clients:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: stream_server
    connection_count:
      name: Number of connections
```

Advanced
--------
It is possible to define multiple stream servers for multiple UARTs simultaneously:

```yaml
uart:
  - id: uart1
    # ...
  - id: uart2
    # ...

stream_server:
  - uart_id: uart1
    port: 1234
  - uart_id: uart2
    port: 1235
```

The stream server has an internal buffer into which UART data is read before it is transmitted over TCP. The size of
this buffer can be changed using the `buffer_size` option, and must be a power of two. Increasing the buffer size above
the default of 128 bytes can help to achieve optimal throughput, and is especially helpful when using high baudrates. It
can also be necessary to increase the [`rx_buffer_size`][uart-config] option of the UART itself.

```yaml
stream_server:
    buffer_size: 2048
```
